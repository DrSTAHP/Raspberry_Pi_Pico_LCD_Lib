# A prototype LCD screen library for Raspberry Pi Pico 
<br>
The library is in early stage of development, primarily because it was in use for private projects only. I've decided to publish it
so I can make something more out of it. List of functions and brief descriptions for some of them can be found in liblcd.h file.

For now it's small enough so you can just put the .c file in your own project area, but if you want an actual library, there's a cmake file provided so you can 
generate a static library (.a).
