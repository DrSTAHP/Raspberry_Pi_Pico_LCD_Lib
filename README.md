# A prototype LCD screen library for Raspberry Pi Pico 
<br>
The library is in early stage of development, primarily because it was in use for private projects only. I've decided to publish it
so I can make something more out of it. List of functions and brief descriptions for some of them can be found in liblcd.h file. 

***It is to be noted that, for now, the lib doesn't support 4-bit mode, so you have to use all 8 data pins.***

For now it's small enough so you can just put the .c file in your own project area, but if you want an actual library, there's a cmake file provided so you can 
generate a static library (.a).
